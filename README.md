# RockPaperScissors

A solution to [the 2nd challenge of 100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/2/3/challenge)

The user is presented with a random move and is asked to select either the winning or losing move.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <img src="Docs/Assets/WinScenario.png" width="45%">
  <img src="Docs/Assets/LoseScenario.png" width="45%">
</div>

If the user makes the correct move, they get a point. Otherwise, they're presented with an alert of the correct move.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="Docs/Assets/IncorrectAnswer.png" width="45%">
</div>

After 10 rounds, the game is over and the player is shown the final result and given the option to play again.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="Docs/Assets/GameOver.png" width="45%">
</div>
